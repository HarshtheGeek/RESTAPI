`This repository will contain the notes of RESTAPI`

# SERVER and CLIENT
A server is a computer or a system that provides resources and data, servies to other computer know as client

`Google`
`Panda`
`Food express`

Are some of the examples


# What is an API?

An **API** (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows one software application to talk to another. It defines how different systems can request and send information to each other.

## Key Points:

- **Interface**: An API acts like a bridge between two systems, making it easier for them to interact.
  
- **Endpoints**: These are specific URLs where requests are made. For example, `https://api.example.com/users` could be an endpoint to get a list of users.
  
- **Requests and Responses**:
  - **GET**: Get (retrieve) data from the API.
  - **POST**: Send (create) data to the API.
  - **PUT**: Update existing data via the API.
  - **DELETE**: Remove data using the API.
  
- **Data Formats**: APIs commonly exchange data in formats like:
  - **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation)
  - **XML** (Extensible Markup Language)

- **Authentication**: APIs often need keys or tokens to ensure secure access.
  
## Types of APIs:

1. **REST**: A popular type of API that uses HTTP requests like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
2. **SOAP**: An older protocol that sends data using XML.
3. **GraphQL**: A newer API format that lets you request specific data.

APIs help different apps or services work together. For example, a weather app might use an API to get data from a weather service.
